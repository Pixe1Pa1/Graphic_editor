  This project implements the backend engine of a simple graphic editor.
  
It supports:
 - **Elements:** Circles (radius) and Rectangles (width Ã— height)  
 - **Grouping:** Elements can be grouped, including nested groups  
 - **Operations:** Add, delete, move, copy elements/groups  
 - **Interaction:** Select the deepest element by coordinates  
 - **Undo/Redo:** Support for undoing and redoing actions  
 - **Traversal & Output:** Iterate through elements and print document structure

The design follows **OOP principles** and uses patterns such as Prototype, Composite, Facade, Command, and Iterator.
